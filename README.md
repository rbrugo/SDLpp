# SDLpp
An object-oriented, RAII-managed wrapper for SDL libraries, written in modern C++ (`C++17`).

## Getting Started

Uhm, at the moment I think there's no way to get started with this project. It is just a repo
  to make me not worry about losing all the progress. Ahah.
  Anyway.

### Prerequisites

All what you need is a C++ compiler supporting the C++ standard `c++17` and a compiled version
of SDL.
And maybe [ranges-v3](https://github.com/ericniebler/range-v3) library from Eric Niebler, 'cause is sooooo cool, you know.

### Installing

No way, actually I not yet know if it will be necessity to compile the wrapper or if it will be an header-only!

## Running the test

...ah, yeah, the tests...

## Build With

...GCC? CLang?

## Versioning

At the moment there's no versioning system. And there's no version. Sorry for this.

## Authors

I don't know if I want to let you know who am I, at this point :D
