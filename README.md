# SDLpp
An object-oriented, RAII-managed wrapper for SDL libraries, written in modern C++ (in particular `c++20`).

## Getting Started
Uhm, at the moment I think there's no way to get started with this project. It is just a repo
  to make me not worry about losing all the progress. Ahah.
  Anyway.

### Prerequisites
All what you need is a C++ compiler supporting the C++ standard `c++20` and a compiled version
of SDL.

## Build With
Any compiler which supports ranges
